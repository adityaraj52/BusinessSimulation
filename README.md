Intercultural Learning Network
The Intercultural Learning Network (ICLN) is a virtual classroom project that focusses on the development of
multicultural management skills. We are using a browser‐based business simulation program, where students
of various nationalities form work groups and compete with each other in a common market. The focus of the
business simulation lies in the development and implementation of an internationalization strategy for a virtual
company in the domestic appliance sector. Each company starts the game in a specific region and has to use
different strategies to expand into other regional markets. All world regions are simulated on the basis of
realistic data, so that each company has a unique starting position. The game simulates the market behavior
based on the decisions of the participating companies, the behavior of the potential customers and the
development of the global economy.
The course is structured into three phases: preparation, simulation and evaluation. During the preparation
phase, each participant has to create an individual skills profile in the ICLN‐Web 2.0 community and use this
profile to apply for his or her role in the company teams. Each team will consist of five students from different
cultural backgrounds and will govern one company. All communication within and between the groups as well
as with the coordinators is carried out in an online environment. The students have to organize their decision‐
making‐process and the allocation of the team’s workload by themselves, which forces them to establish clear
communication structures. In the evaluation phase, all participants have to create a presentation video and as
well as a group report in which they describe and evaluate their chosen strategy.
The seminar will be offered during the winter term and will be conducted over the scope of twelve weeks. It is
aimed at Master students of all countries and cultural backgrounds that study in a business related program.
Each participating university may include this course in their curriculum and select the participating students of
their region. Further each university has to determine a responsible lecturer, who has to grade his own
students according to his home institutions rules. The Clausthal University of Technology recommends his own
grading scheme to its partners, but all universities have to develop their own grading scheme how they will
evaluate the different tasks of the students during the seminar (e.g. Strategy paper, critical evaluation, SWOT
and DESTEP analysis). The number of participants is limited to a maximum of 25 students per region. Since the
participation of each student is essential, the enrolment will have to be binding for them during the course of
the seminar.
The primary learning objectives for this course are the gaining of a better understanding about the influences
of cultural differences on teamwork in strategic decisions, the practical application of theoretical economic
knowledge, the knowledge of macroeconomic and microeconomic volatility in markets to react accordingly
with a forward looking orientation and the ability to assess opportunities and risks in global markets and
formulate and implement goal oriented global and regional plans. In addition the students learn to use
management information technologies (MIT) to govern global business teams.
